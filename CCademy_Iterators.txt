Iterator -For Each

let fruits = ['mango', 'papaya', 'pineapple', 'apple'];
// Iterate over fruits below
fruits.forEach(fruit => console.log(' I want to eat a ' + fruit));

let words = ['unique', 'uncanny', 'pique', 'oxymoron', 'guise'];

// Something is missing in the method call below

console.log(words.some(function(word) {
  return word.length < 6;
}));

// Use filter to create a new array

let interestingWords = words.filter(word => word.length > 5);

// Make sure to uncomment the code below and fix the incorrect code before running it

console.log(interestingWords.every(word =>  word.length > 5      ));

Review: Iterators
You have learned a number of useful methods in this lesson as well as how to use the JavaScript documentation from the Mozilla Developer Network to discover and understand additional methods. Let's review!

.forEach() is used to execute the same code on every element in an array but does not change the array and returns undefined.
.map() executes the same code on every element in an array and returns a new array with the updated elements.
.filter() checks every element in an array to see if it meets certain criteria and returns a new array with the elements that return truthy for the criteria.
All iterator methods can be written using arrow function syntax. In fact, given the succinctness and the implicit return of arrow function syntax, this is quickly becoming the preferred way to write these types of method calls.
You can visit the Mozilla Developer Network to learn more about iterator methods (and all other parts of JavaScript!).
Additional iterator methods such as .some(), .every(), .reduce() perform different functions.
